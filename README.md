## Details of the scripts provided to perform analysis and generate plots for the paper: Patient-specific computational models predict prognosis in B cell lymphoma by quantifying pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic signatures from genetic sequencing data.

- Cell cycle and apoptosis model simulations
  - Apoptosis_WTvsBcl2.ipynb: run apoptosis model to simulate Bcl2 mutations and compare to WT
  - ApoptosisDist.ipynb: parameter distribution to simulate heterogeneous cell populations
  - CellCycle_WTvsMycOE.ipynb: run cell cycle model to simulate Myc mutations and compare to WT
  - CellCycleParamDist.ipynb: parameter distribution to simulate heterogeneous cell populations
  - GridPlot.ipynb: generate plots for cell cycle model parameter distribution simulations
  - Cell_cycle_ParamScan.ipynb: parameter scan - modify one parameter in the cell cycle model at a time, run simulation, save output and plot
  - PD_CellCycle_param_analysis: analyse the value of parameters in different groups of cells from the parameter distribution - example given is p27 in dividing cells vs arrested cells 
- Running single or multiple (in parallel) patient simulations
  - runMultiscaleModel.ipynb 
- Calculating cell numbers for patients
  - calculateCellNumbersForAllConditions.ipynb 
- Plotting mutational synergy correlations
  - run: [patientData/scatter_plots_syn_res_updated_synergyCalcs.ipynb](patientData/scatter_plots_syn_res_updated_synergyCalcs.ipynb)
