## Figure 2

Panels B, C and E were generated using data from simulations using the multi-scale model. 

The dockerMultiscaleModel folder contains a Dockerfile and a link to instructions to load a docker image that includes eveything required to run the multiscale model.

Further instructions for running the model are included as comments in sections of the jupyter notebook file runMultiscaleModel.ipynb

To run individual mutations and double hits you need to define the model conditions in the section entitled 'Classic double hits'.
