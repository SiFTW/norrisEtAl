## Figure 4

Panel A was generated using PlotMutSims.ipynb using data from cell 1 from each 'all mutations' simulations for each patient.

Kaplan Meier plots were generated from data in valuesAt6hours.csv. The file valuesAt6hours_stratification.xlsx contains data uploaded to bioinformatics.com.cn with column headings: 'PFs', 'Status', 'Category'. Columns HP and HQ contain data representing the status of patients for pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic factors and are highlighted in green with the titles 'cMyct' and 'Bcl2t' respectively. The columns  contain macros linked to columns B and E which calculate the mean average of all values for patients in each category and whether the value for each individual is higher or lower than the mean average.
