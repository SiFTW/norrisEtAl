Panel A was generated using PlotMutSims.ipynb using data from cell 1 from each 'all mutations' simulations for each patient.

Kaplan Meier plots were generated from data in csv files for each cohort (C1, C2, C3 & C4). The output files from this script for each cohort contain 'PFs', 'Status' and 'Category' data which was uploaded to https://www.statskingdom.com/kaplan-meier.html to generate individual plots.
